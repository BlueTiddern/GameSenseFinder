In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe.\n\nThe game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them.

It was published by Psygnosis for the PC and PlayStation, and by Sega for the Saturn (only in Europe).\n\nIn Discworld II the player controls Rincewind the \"wizzard\" (voiced by Eric Idle, as in the previous game) who has been burdened with the task of coercing Death out of his impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The plot borrows from a number of Discworld books, most notably Reaper Man, Moving Pictures and Lords and Ladies.\n\nIt all begins in a quiet Ankh-Morpork street, where Rincewind and The Librarian inexplicably fail to die from a nearby cart-bomb explosion. The odd event is not shared by them alone however: occurrences of the newly dead re-awakening and disturbing the populace are being reported all over the city, prompting the Archchancellor of Unseen University to halt his usual activities of feasting and merrymaking, and to take charge of the situation. Much to Rincewind's despair, the entirety of this process involves appointing him to the task of finding Death and convincing him to resume his work.",

You eat, if only for the nourishment, and then collapse to sleep like a pile of mud on the floor. Every morning you wake up, and do it again.\nYour room is a mess that you never clean up, a reflection of the desolation in your heart. Still, you never snap: You hold it together, in a twisted subversion of your gentle nature.\n\nOne day, things change.\n\u201cWhat cramped, filthy confines. Protists. This is why we call them primitive, I suppose.\u201d\nYou've just gotten back to your decrepit apartment and slunk your blubber into the futon...\nThat's when an explosion of light and a flood of sound fill your apartment.\nThere, like a thunderclap, stands a stranger. You stand stunned.\n\nShe's beautiful. Some category past supermodel that you've never even heard of. It's well beyond the level of just a pretty face.\nShe exudes natural confidence in an aura so strong you can see it. Her sculpted face screams sex with a kind of perfection that not even her disgruntled expression could ever hope to scratch.\n\nAnd then\u2014then there's her chest. Stunning, voluminous mounds. To put it vulgarly, hot DAMN those are nice tits.\nYou do a quick double-take. Those things would put any porn actress to shame.\nIf the rest of her were any less breathtaking, you might not be able to get your eyes off them. Those breasts are enough of a feast for the eyes to satisfy you for a lifetime, on their own.\nOn top of which, her clothes aren't doing much to hide them. More than half of their curvaceous expanse is right there, exposed, for you to worship.\n\nThis absolute unit of a woman is standing there, radiating self-certainty, dressed in the kind of scandalous outfit you'd never expect to see outside of anime and games. Are those horns on her head\u2060...? Are those part of the costume? They don't look natural, but... while you're busy gaping, she gets in your face. She smells good. Sweet, and sexy, and almost violently tempting, the scent seems to leap right into you.\n\nThis mysterious woman\u2060\u2014the Demon Queen, to hear her tell it\u2060\u2014licks her lips with a bewitching smile as she pushes you down.\nShe needs to stock up on magic\u2060, and it seems you're a tanker.\n\n\u201cYou're a veritable fountainhead of energy... It's difficult to believe that you never realized what you had hanging between your legs.\u201d\n\nSqueezing your throbbing hard-on, smiling like a cat, she goes on to explain.\nTo go back to her original world\u2060\u2014to replenish her wasted magic reserves\u2060\u2014she's going to be drinking deep from your stores of semen. Now you're the voluptuous Demon Queen's personal magic cock, getting squeezed out on the daily in your old shoebox apartment\u2060\u2014and things won't be the same for you ever again.",

        "storyline": "Taking place in 1830, Circle of the Moon is set in one of the fictional universes of the Castlevania series. The premise of the original series is the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Circle of the Moon's protagonist, however, is Nathan Graves, whose parents died a decade ago to banish Dracula. Morris Baldwin, who helped in Dracula's banishment, trained him to defeat Dracula and the monsters; Morris ultimately chose him as his successor and gave him the \"Hunter Whip\", to the displeasure of Hugh, Morris' son who trained alongside him.\n\nAt an old castle, Camilla, a minion of Dracula, revives him, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Morris, Nathan, and Hugh. Before they are able to banish him again, Dracula destroys the floor under Nathan and Hugh, causing them to plummet down a long tunnel. Surviving the fall and wishing to find his father, Hugh leaves Nathan behind. Nathan proceeds to search the castle for his mentor. Along the way, he learns that at the next full moon, Morris' soul will be used to return Dracula to full power. He also periodically encounters Hugh, who becomes more hostile as the game progresses. Eventually, Nathan encounters Camilla, who hints that she and Dracula are responsible for the changes in his personality. Nathan vanquishes Camilla in her true form and meets up with Hugh once more. Upon seeing him, Hugh immediately attacks him with the goal of proving himself to his father through Nathan's defeat; Nathan, however, realizes that Dracula is controlling Hugh. Nathan defeats him, and Dracula's control over Hugh breaks. Confessing that he doubted his self-worth when Nathan was chosen as successor, Hugh tasks him with Morris' rescue.\n\nArriving at the ceremonial room, Nathan confronts Dracula, who confirms that he had tampered with Hugh's soul to cause the changes in his personality. They begin to fight and halfway through, Dracula teleports away to gain his full power. Hugh then frees his father and tasks Nathan with Dracula's banishment. Nathan continues the battle and defeats Dracula; escaping the collapsing castle, he reunites with Morris and Hugh. Nathan is declared a master vampire hunter by Morris. Hugh vows to retrain under Morris due to his failure.",
        "summary": "Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is the first of the series to be based on the action/RPG structure of Castlevania:Symphony of the Night rather than the level-based action style of all previous Castlevania games. Dracula's castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.",

They, that is, those who bore the burden of the revolution on their backs and then were ignored, when the day of reckoning came they confronted their enemies with the built-up anger they felt at all the injustices they faced. \n \nIn June 1848, an uprising that started in the suburbs of Paris was harshly suppressed by the army, and from among the rebels seven workers were arrested for the killing of a general. Modest Hero is a game about the last journey of an ordinary man among those prisoners. As he is dragged towards the end that awaits him, our hero Victor travels in his imagination to his memories of the beginning of his life's most important adventure. \n \nThe game begins at the peak of the Age of Revolutions in France on the streets of a city left desolate by a violent civil war. The modest hero of the game, Victor, and his six captured friends like him, are downhearted and angry but somewhat hopeful as they proceed towards the place where they will be judged, because the instinct to survive, even in the most appalling situations, can produce brazen courage.",

        "storyline": "What was supposed to be a nice winter hike in the Mount Washington State Park with friends, turned into a dire situation. You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, thirst, hunger, wildlife and your own state of mind while finding your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help.\n\nWinter Survival is a fully fledged survival game even going into Early Access, with dynamic combat, stealth, base building and its unique sanity system just to name a few. Multiple game modes and difficulties allow you to experience the game differently and tailor it to your taste.\n\nVenture through snow-covered forests, mountains, and frozen lakes. Grapple with treacherous terrain, deadly animals, and harsh winter conditions. Find shelter, cook meals, and rest, ready to face the next day. Hope it won\u2019t be your last\u2026\n\nYou are not the first person to visit this area. There have been many before you. More than a century ago some even lived here. If you explore your surroundings you may find things they left behind that will still be useful to you. Explore various areas and discover their story, like a town built by people who are long gone. Force open doors, avoid traps, and make abandoned structures work again. Find personal belongings as you dive deeper into the town\u2019s past. Will you be able to uncover its secrets?\n\nCold, thirst, hunger and physical as well as mental exhaustion are the five major factors you have to worry about. It doesn\u2019t however end there. Injuries and sickness are other factors and then there is the weather. Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isn\u2019t any better either. Don\u2019t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable.\n\nFurther variety comes in with our event system where random events can save your day unexpectedly or make the nightmare even worse. Things do not have to be that bleak or stay that way all the time. The adaptation system allows you to open up new survival skills and strengthen your abilities. And then there is our unique sanity system to make things really interesting\u2026\n\nThe most deviant enemy in a desolate land, is one\u2019s mind. In Winter Survival you will experience an unforgiving world where it\u2019s hard to distinguish reality from madness, due to the unique sanity system.\n\nIn reality, your mind becomes a problem way sooner than starvation. It starts with fatigue symptoms, losing your will to continue the struggle up to imagining things and even full blown hallucinations. Fear and the stress associated with it form another layer that can influence your perception and together all these factors make for a highly interesting and different survival experience.\n\nHunt or be hunted. Use the environment to your advantage. Observe your prey, study its behaviour, make and set traps to capture animals. Craft torches to scare away wolves. Make spears to throw at prey and protect yourself from apex predators that surround the area.\n\nGiven limited resources, think twice before starting a fight. A bear is a mighty predator and going against one with a knife or even a spear might not be the brightest idea. Maybe avoiding the danger or sneaking past a potential encounter is the smarter choice given the circumstance?\n\nGather resources, learn how to craft all sorts of useful things and build shelters and other structures to escape everyday struggles.\nSome resources are easy to find, some are only available in certain areas, others have to be gained from hunting and some are left behind by those before you.\n\nThe extended crafting system ranges from simple campfires to cook food to building entire shelters and protective structures wherever you please. It is the crafting and building system that will allow you to slowly transition from unbearable danger to a more manageable environment - if you prepare properly.\n\nIt is up to you how you want to play the game and we give you 3 different modes to choose from:\n\nStory Mode: Learn more about yourself and people long gone while you struggle to survive. Find your friends and get back home.\n\nColdwave: Risk your life in an ultimate survival experience. Brave the elements of an ever-changing weather and see how far you can go before the wilderness claims you.\n\nEndless Mode: Take advantage of more resources and crafting options as you try to conquer the world around you. Start and proceed how you want.",

There is no exam and there are no strict trials you must go through. There is no strict approval process also. Detectives are very much like ordinary people. They don't have any special authority for investigations per say. So for example, when a detective ask someone about something or they ask for a survey or when they are on a stakeout, they may be mistaken as a stalker or suspicious person. This means they might be reported to the police. Since this is the case, Japanese detectives should be quick on their feet and should be able to lie and make good excuses on the spot.\nI was originally a good person who was very bad at lying, but during my detective work over the past 10 years, I had become a good liar and deceiver. This is a detective adventure game made by someone who is good at deceiving people.",
