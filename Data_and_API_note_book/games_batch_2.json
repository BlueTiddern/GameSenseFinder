        "storyline": "In 2007, scientists discovered a parallel universe. The U.S. government sent a probe to that universe and learned of the existence of an entire alien civilization there. However, an apparently hostile alien damages the probe, leading to the creation of a black hole threatening the very existence of our own world. Former U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. Cutter Slade is assigned to escort three scientists to the parallel universe in an attempt to repair the probe and avert the danger.\n\nUpon arrival, Cutter is separated from the scientists and is greeted by the local inhabitants, the Talan. It appears that their world, Adelpha, has its own troubles: a mysterious being known as Fa\u00e9 Rhan has been assembling an army consisting of Talans who think themselves superior to the rest of the population and are willing to rule over them with violence. Cutter is proclaimed the Ulukai, a savior mentioned in a prophecy, and entrusted with the task of retrieving five sacred relics needed to overthrow Fa\u00e9 Rhan - all while trying to locate the scientists and save the Earth as well in the process.",
        "summary": "Outcast is a 3D third-person (with an optional first-person view) action game with adventure elements. In search of five sacred relics, the protagonist travels through the five continents of Adelpha (plus one tutorial island). Each land has its own landscape (mountains, lakes, forests), populated areas, as well as dozens of minor problems - small quests that the hero is required to solve. Most Talans populating the world can be conversed with about a variety of topics. A large portion of the game consists of finding key characters and performing quests for them; some of these are optional, though most must be completed in an adventure-like linear fashion in order to advance the plot. Cutter is free to travel between the continents using special portals.\n\nApart from exploration and completing quests, Cutter will also fight many guards and creatures. At his disposal are six futuristic weapons (railgun and others); ammunition for those guns is scattered around and can also be produced by mixing items. Aiming help is provided in the form of laser sights. Sneaking up to the enemy and punching him out silently is also possible. Gadgets such as a holo-decoy can be used to help Cutter gain the upper hand in combat. The player character can also jump, climb, swim, dive, crawl, and ride a local animal known as Twon-Ha for faster travel.",

Use a magnifying glass to search the map or the destination screen to catch insects. Insects live in different places depending on the species, and the insects that appear are real.\n\nTime passes all the time during a game, and for every second that passes, one minute of in-game time passes. The day in the game also starts at 7:00 AM and ends at 9:00 PM, so there are 14 hours of activity per day. Each day in the game changes over time, which can change the insects you catch. Other in-game times can be advanced by fiddling with the clock on the screen.\n\nInsects collected during the game may be viewed from the game title or from an illustrated book during the game. The total number of insects featured is 310, and sampling 200 of these insects is the ending. The collected insects can also be exchanged with other players via a link cable. At the beginning of the game, players are told that they have to catch 200 different insects in 30 days, but even after 30 days, no penalty such as game over is imposed.\n\nThe game cartridge is a vibrating cartridge equipped with a vibration function, and by setting AAA batteries in the cartridge, it will vibrate when an insect is caught, etc. Also included in the game software was an appendix \u6606\u866b\u56f3\u9451\u30df\u30cb\u30d6\u30c3\u30af( Insect Pictorial Book Minibook), which contained information on insects appearing in the game.",

Ebisumaru is defined as lazy and perverted. Their kunai-throwing friend Sasuke is a mechanical ninja (made by the Wise Man of Iga) who enjoys hot baths and Japanese tea.

She knew the value of things of this kind. The summer came over. Leaves fell off the trees. The snow covered the ground, and the boy never came to the old woman`s mind again.\n\nThe lad wasn\u2019t satisfied with the camp from the very first day. He could get over the loss of direct contact with other children, and he could accept the communication with them only by rapping out on the wall of cell. He could acquiesce with the camp guiders who were dressed in white gowns instead of scout uniforms. On the other hand the attractions disgusted him. They promised him sun, water, merry-go-round and lots of fun. It is hard to say what kind of source it was but they surely shone something on him. Anyway he grew one meter up and he became much stronger. It was exactly what he had always wanted to happen. On the other hand there was lots of pain in it. More than he expected.\n\nAnd then, one day after many years, he woke up and unplugged himself from all those beeping-in-panic devices. Because he didn\u2019t find anyone in the laboratory he came finally to light. Prague is nice but too deserted. The city is almost empty except hordes of strange creatures driven by very simple killing philosophy. There are enough enemies for each hand!",

        "storyline": "Ico:\nIn a remote, sunlit forest, several masked men travel on horseback to the edge of an enormous sheer cliff overlooking the sea. Off the coast is an otherworldly, dilapidated fortress, built on tall rocky spires. Some of the men have horns on their helmet. These horns look like those of Malus's head. The men proceed down a winding path towards sea level, get in a small boat, and row silently towards the castle.\n\nThey have a prisoner with them: Ico, a boy with an immediately identifiable characteristic: two large horns protruding from his head. These horns are the result of an ancient curse, one that has stricken Ico's village for generations and earned him all its hatred and blame for whatever misfortune comes to its residents. The men have taken him to the castle after his twelfth birthday to place him in a mysterious coffin deep inside the fortress's darkened halls, where he will either starve or succumb to the cold. To open the way to the coffin, they take an enchanted sword that has the ability to open the idol-shaped gates that lead to the room.\n\nThe men force him into the coffin, ordering him not to resist and telling him they do this \"for the good of the village\". After they leave, however, a tremor caused by the castle's many aged moving parts dislodges Ico's coffin from the wall, breaking it open but knocking him unconscious. During this time, he experiences a strange vision, set in another part of the castle - a spiked stone cage hangs from the ceiling of an enormous cylindrical room. As Ico approaches the cage on a spiral path that runs up the room's walls, a shadowy substance amasses at the bottom of the cage, overflowing and dripping onto the floor far below. Another shadow emerges from the walls behind Ico, engulfing him and ending the vision. He wakes up.\n\nIco begins to explore the old castle, pulling levers and opening doors in search of a way out. Soon, however, he finds himself at the bottom of exactly the same room he saw in the vision, including the metal cage hanging from the ceiling. Ico ascends the spiral path until he reaches the top of the room again. This time the cage contains a young girl, Yorda, who sits there quietly. Ico calls out to her and promises to find a way to let her out. He reaches a lever, which lowers the cage close to the ground. Ico makes his way back down and jumps on the cage, sending it and a dislodged piece of wood crashing to the floor. The impact opens up the cage door, freeing Yorda.\n\nShadow of the Colossus:\nOne cloudy night, a lone hawk flies by two longtime companions - Wander and his horse Agro - navigating an unforgiving cliffside path on the edge of a canyon. The two have been traveling for a long time on this offbeat path, through murky forests and wet grasslands alike.\n\nThey arrive at last at their destination: a tall stone gate with a narrow passage. On the other side lies an enormous bridge of near-otherworldly construction. The bridge spans over the Forbidden Lands, a dramatic landscape of plains and canyons with enclosed and cut-off environments ranging from arid deserts to clefts with tall geysers to dark forests and murky crevasses.\n\nThe bridge finally comes to an end at the Shrine of Worship, a gigantic structure in the middle of the Lands. Wander and Agro make their way to the ground floor and the temple's main hall, which is lined with sixteen stone idols. At the end of the empty hall is an altar. Here it is shown that Wander is carrying something with him: a body wrapped in a cloth sheet. He places the body on the altar and removes the sheet, revealing Mono, a young woman clothed in a white dress.\n\nThe game suddenly cuts to a picture of an owl mask amidst a cloudy sky. From here, Lord Emon, a spiritual leader in Wander's society, speaks an esoteric monologue:\n\nThat place...began from the resonance of intersecting points...\nThey are memories replaced by ens and naught and etched into stone.\nBlood, young sprouts, sky - and the one with the ability to control beings created from light...\nIn that world, it is said that if one should wish it, one can bring back the souls of the dead.\nBut to trespass upon that land is strictly forbidden...\nAgro is suddenly frightened by a noise from behind the trio. Several shadowy apparitions are emerging from the temple floor, and Wander sees this and draws a mysterious sword from its sheath, pointing it towards the shadows. The blade emits an otherworldly energy, and the creatures immediately dissolve into thin air. Immediately, a booming pair of voices fill the halls from a great aperture above, surprised that Wander possesses the \"Ancient Sword\". Wander correctly identifies the voices as belonging to Dormin and asks that Mono be revived. Initially, Dormin expresses an indifference towards the matter, but ultimately cannot hide the interest in the sword Wander carries.",
        "summary": "The core game and story for both Ico (2001) and Shadow of the Colossus (2005) remain unchanged with the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphical overhaul to allow them to support modern high-definition displays up to 1080p. With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow of the Colossus was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses. Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing, as evidenced by the large landscapes. Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound.\n\nIco's remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing the game, the player can restart to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player character's companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda. Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support, it was not released with it.\n\nThe collection includes bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Ueda's next game, The Last Guardian.",

All of the contents of the sky are sucked in, leaving nothing left.\n\nThe work going entirely to waste angers the Queen, leaving the condition of her relationship with the King questionable in nature.
