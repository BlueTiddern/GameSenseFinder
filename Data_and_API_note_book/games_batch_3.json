Trisha Pettywood, a journalist out to expose the truth of the Necronomicon, is the host, with her guest, the parapsychologist and best-selling author Professor Alex Eldridge, a colleague of the late Professor Raymond Knowby, who has written a book based on the Necronomicon. Ash is sitting at his favorite bar in the red-light district, having a few drinks during the broadcast, and badmouths Eldridge, claiming that he wouldn't know the real Necronomicon from \"a roll of extra-fluffy two-ply\". The bartender, who apparently knows Ash, gives him a free drink, telling him that he is sorry about Jenny, a subject which is apparently still very painful for Ash. Trisha also mentions a local Dearborn man (namely Ash) who claims that the Necronomicon can raise the dead and interdimensionally travel through time, but Eldridge dismisses it as the sad, depraved ramblings of a lunatic, while also claiming that it is easy to get caught up in the book's mythology. Hearing this, a drunken Ash babbles on about his remark, and also about his fights with the Deadites and how he had to amputate his own right hand. Trisha has somehow obtained the tape recording of Professor Knowby, and plays it live as a \"treat\" to the viewers. Ash, knowing what will happen if they do so, shouts at them not to play it, but of course, they do not hear him. The Deadites are released into the world once more, and the Evil Force floats through town, right into the bar, and possesses the bartender who is promptly shot down by Ash who strangely has his boomstick with him.",

The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.\n\nThe game features a humorous plot revolving around the central character, an octopus who is undercover as an average human with a family. The plot revolves around the player, controlling Octodad, attempting to complete various household chores and tasks while maintaining his secret. The gameplay takes advantage of the setting of an octopus' acting of a human to present an idea of mundane tasks being much more out of control, with a key mechanic being the suspicion towards Octodad from various family members. Its sequel Dadliest Catch was released on January 30, 2014, and was one of the first titles to be given the Steam Greenlight.\n\nOctodad is a freeware independent video game developed by a group of students at DePaul University, many of whom would go on to form Young Horses, Inc., the developers of its sequel Octodad: Dadliest Catch. The game was developed for the Student Showcase of the 2011 Independent Games Festival, and would go on to be one of 8 winners in the Student Showcase award of that year.",

When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.\n\nThere is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.\n\nThe game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the gang's hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone.

Realizing the system covertly brings harm to the innocent citizens of San Francisco, he decides to work with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's CTOS 2.0, and Blume, the company behind it.\n\nMarcus joins DedSec and works with fellow hackers Sitara, Wrench, Horatio and Josh, and they begin using their skills to expose corrupt organizations and corporations that are secretly using stolen personal CTOS data for their own personal gain. The game begins with Marcus's DedSec initiation test: deleting his own CTOS profile from the database. Being successful, he is accepted into DedSec. He is soon alerted about a fake church called New Dawn that serves as a criminal organization. Eventually, Marcus stumbles upon the existence of Bellwether, a data manipulation program being fed CTOS data by Du\u0161an Nemec, Blume's CTO, to manipulate world finance and politics. DedSec later manages to recruit the assistance of old-time hacker Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney, who is determined to battle Blume.\n\nWith his assistance, DedSec manage to expose the corruption of the FBI and numerous Silicon Valley corporations, such as Nudle, Tidis, and Galilei, and take down the ringleaders of the Tezcas, a violent street gang who kidnapped DedSec member Horatio Carlin and killed him after he refused to cooperate with them. Learning that Blume is planning to install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area of one of the satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Du\u0161an for good, Marcus breaks into Blume's San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Du\u0161an's corruption. Du\u0161an is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume.\n\nIn an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and that it is time to put their own plans into motion, possibly signaling a third Watch Dogs game.",

They figure that the Alien is using the ducts inside the ship to move around, and Dallas suggests leading the Alien to the main airlock. The player then gets to decide if Ripley, Parker or Dallas goes into the ducts. The player grabs a flamethrower, motion tracker, Maintenance Jack and possibly a flare and Medikit. They then meet with Ash, who tells them that the security systems has shut a number of doors, so they'll have to gather equipment en route. The player descends a ladder to B Deck, and Ash seals the hatch behind them. \n \nWhile avoiding being killed by the Alien, the player seals maintenance hatches 00B1 and 00B2. They then pass through the landing claw bay, where Brett's corpse is located, and seal either hatch 00B3 or 00B4. After sealing the hatch, Ash tells them to find the primary air shaft system, and lead the Alien to C Deck. There, Ash can connect to the airlock systems from his terminal. After entering the primary air shafts, the player's motion tracker begins malfunctioning. Lambert finds the player on her motion tracker and tells them that the Alien is also inside the shafts. Lambert attempts to guide the player through the shafts while they avoid the Alien. Eventually, the player reaches the end of the shafts and drops down to C Deck. \n \nThe player then has to connect Ash to the airlock systems. Ash tells them that he's opening the outer airlock, but it'll take some time, so they should find somewhere to hide. Eventually, Ash informs them that it's primed, and instructs the player to wait for the Alien to enter the outer airlock chamber and be ready to close it in. Once the Alien enters the airlock, the player approaches the airlock and presses the button to seal the airlock. However, Ash tells them that something strange is happening, and the switch does not work. An alarm inside the airlock activates, and the Alien flees, knocking out the player. Once they wake up, Ash is waiting for them. \n \nIt ends with a shot of the med lab, as Ash's voice is heard delivering his iconic monologue from the movie: \"Bring back lifeform. Priority one. All other priorities rescinded. You still don't understand what you're dealing with do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. I admire its purity. A survivor. Unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality. Last word. I can't lie to you about your chances. But... you have my sympathies.\"",

He instructs the deputy to meet up with him as fast as he can and also suggested locking down the area as well. However, Waits' lead was proven to be false as the Drone was in fact revealed to be in Prisoner Processing with Ricardo still in it. Ricardo before reaching an elevator, managed to collect numerous prisoner tags from deceased inmates on the way, collect the visitor registry data and lockdown the area's armory.\n\nWaits informs Ricardo about Gardiner, a fellow marshal who was supposed to have delivered a package, was not checking in. The elevator stops at Seegson Synthetics with Ricardo exploring the area. The area is filled with corpses, with the one closest to the package presumably being Gardiner. The \"package\" is revealed to be explosives, with Waits intending to use them against the Alien. Ricardo takes them from a table and leaves for the elevator, but not before finding a private message sent from Nina Taylor to Waits regarding the flight recorder. The elevator is revealed to be dysfunctional, with Ricardo being forced to turn the power back on for it to work. Ricardo revamps power to the area whilst also unintentionally activating numerous Working Joe androids in the process that began to prowl the perimeter. Ricardo also activates an alarm, attempting to lure the Alien to him so that it can follow him to the area where he will set the explosives. He later calls for the elevator and escapes.\n\nRicardo reaches the area, the Alien having followed him. Under the duress of the Drone, Ricardo manages to send a conformation message to Waits to update the marshal on his progress and activate an evac alarm, encouraging all remaining survivors within the quarters to flee the area. Ricardo eventually plants the explosives and takes leave in an elevator. As the screen cuts to black and displays the score menu, a muffled explosion can be heard, shortly followed by the beginning of Diane Verlaine's distraught message sent to Sevastopol, (audio log 32). This reveals that the explosion that severed the EVA line and separated Amanda from Taylor and Samuels, thus kick-starting Ripley's journey throughout Sevastopol, was in-fact the result of Ricardo's set explosives.",

Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms.\n\nEach level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level.\n\nSwitchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD. Originally called Crazy Ball, the game won \"Best PC Game\" during the 2005 Swedish Game Awards and was a finalist in the \"Technical Excellence Class\" during the 2006 Independent Games Festival.

Subsequently, it was also included in several series anthologies. The game was never published in standalone form. The game began as a mod based on the Might and Magic V engine, which was released in 1993. Personalities from Catware were responsible for leading the modding effort, with story contributions from Ellen Beeman. As development progressed, collaboration with New World Computing was established, and the mod received publishing support.\n\nSwords of Xeen exploits some quirks of the engine to great effect, such as morphing monsters by using the regular animation of one monster and the attack animation of another.

        "storyline": "Warmage \u2013 Build a Kingdom\nWelcome to the most exciting indie strategy game with the taste of fantasy, heroes and summoned creatures. Your objective is simple: Build a kingdom, expand your empire and territory by taking down the enemies and building farms, training halls, watchtowers, summoning tower, mercenary outpost and more.\n\nHow to Play the Warmage\nWhen your first open the game, you either can play campaign mode or start a random battle against the AI (artificial intelligence). When you start a quick auto combat battle, you start a war and get to fight against orcs, dark mages, bandits, lizardmen and draconians. Before going in to a battle, make sure you have already arranged, trained and equipped your team and you\u2019ve chosen some perfect heroes. You can always summon new heroes whether they are common, rare or epic.\nNote that, each unit has different abilities and before the combat battles get started, as a leader and commander you need to know about the power of your fantasy heroes and use the best combination in your kingdom-builder army.\nExpanding your territory lets you create and build more farms, and selling the extra food you produce brings you more Gold. The more gold you have, the more power to build your kingdom stronger and quicker.\n\nIs it easy to learn and play?\nThis strategy and kingdom game is super easy to learn and play. On the screen, you can see the whole world, the buildings, your army and of course the enemy group. To move your team, you just need to tap on the hex and specify the next step. You can also easily arrange your team, expand your territory, and start a war. So. It\u2019s all about tapping and swiping.\nThe Help button on the left corner of the screen is always providing some good tips.\n\nWarmage \u2013 Build a Kingdom Main Features:\n\u2022 Easy to learn gameplay and simple yet engaging UI\n\u2022 Quick auto combat battles\n\u2022 Play campaign mode\n\u2022 Revolutionary new text dungeon mode - send a single adventurer to the underground tunnels and watch his/her journal entries\n\u2022 Collect XP and epic items from there while you walk to school, run or ride a bike (The motion detector will progress the adventure while you are moving)\n\u2022 Common, Rare and Epic heroes for a more fantasy epic story\n\u2022 Use training to make your team stronger and try different tactics and combination for different enemies\n\u2022 Collect legendary artifacts: from wood staff and heal potion to Summoning scroll and Silver sword and more\n\nWarmage provides you with everything you need to build a kingdom and expand your territory. At first, you just need to take some time to get familiar with the game\u2019s environment, units\u2019 movements, strategies, building, and ways to earn gold, and after that you will act as a leader to assemble a team of heroes and summoned creatures and fight against the darkness.\n\nNotes:\n\n- This is an open-source game and it uses graphics and sounds from another open-source game legally and with permission.\n\n- Updates will come with planned new features: more mini-games like an endless auto combat game, mining game.\n\n- Suggestions/ideas/bug reports are welcome please send them here: warmagedev@gmail.com",
