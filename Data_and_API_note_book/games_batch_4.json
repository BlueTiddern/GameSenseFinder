Otherwise, the evil host will be alerted of your location and you will have to run and hide! Don't get caught!

Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself.\n\nVyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodara directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission.",

After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAs you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.\n\nUnlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played.

Blaming the half-genie for the town being in disarray and failing to do her job properly, Mayor Scuttlebutt fires her as Scuttle Town's Guardian.\n\nDespite no longer being a Guardian Genie, Shantae still decides to take responsibility to stop Risky Boots' newest plot. Mimic reveals to Shantae that three hidden magic seals are necessary to release the lamp's magic, and Shantae sets out to find them. With help from her friend, the zombie Rottytops, she learns that the seals are in possession of three treasure hunters, the Barons of Sequin Land, whom she will have to confront to obtain the seals. While she pursues the Barons, Risky tricks Rottytops and her brothers into kidnapping Mimic for her, promising them a lifetime supply of coffee needed to maintain their sanity, and particularly, Shantae's brains for Rottytops. Shantae, now in possession of the three seals, reaches them as Risky reveals her deception. Shantae surrenders the seals in exchange for Mimic's life. Risky then sucks Shantae's magical half into the lamp before revealing to Shantae that it has the power to capture and enslave genies, then she unleashes the magical half as the evil Nega-Shantae, ordering it to destroy Shantae. Shantae manages to defeat her counterpart, and flees from Risky's hideout as it collapses.

The game employs a modified version of id Software's id Tech 2 engine\u2014originally used for Quake 2\u2014and incorporates music from films by director Wong Kar-wai, which were originally performed by Xavier Cugat. Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common first-person shooter elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.\n\nGravity Bone received critical acclaim from video game journalists. It was called \"a pleasure to experience\" by Charles Onyett from IGN, and received comparisons to games such as Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The game was praised for its cohesive story, atmosphere and its ability to catch the player's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete. It received the \"Best Arthouse Game\" award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008. A sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, was released in 2012.",

She is forced to fight through the crypt's dungeon with her actions tied to the beat of the music and her heart, so as to stay alive and defeat the NecroDancer.\n\nNear the heart of the crypt, Cadence finds one of the NecroDancer's minions named \"Dead Ringer\". She defeats him, revealing that it was her missing father and frees him from the NecroDancer's control, allowing him to help her defeat the NecroDancer. They take the NecroDancer's magical golden Lute and use it to kill him, and then use its power to resurrect Cadence's dead mother, Melody. However, they discover that the lute is cursed; Melody must keep playing it forever to sustain her life, but the lute will gradually consume her humanity just as it did to the NecroDancer. Melody enters the crypt in search of answers and a way to break the curse of the lute.\n\nWhen Melody reaches the end of the crypt, she uses the Golden Lute to resurrect the NecroDancer and find answers, but he attacks and Melody defeats him. The NecroDancer tries to flee but is cast into a crevice by Aria (Melody's mother) who was lying in a coffin with a dagger in her chest and is brought back to life by the Lute. Aria reveals that she knows how to break the curse of the lute, but was betrayed by the NecroDancer and left for dead. Intending to finish what she started, she begins her ascent out of the crypt in search of a shrine that will destroy the lute once and for all.\n\nWhen Aria reaches the shrine, she is attacked by the lute itself, which mutates into a large monster in an attempt to save itself from destruction.

Sixty stages await you, filled with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly difficult! \n \nPlaces you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath. \n \nAs in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack. \n \nExplore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's Curse!",

Infocom was closed in 1989 by its then-parent company Activision. Still holding the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles, Activision bundled 20 of the most popular into this package. The games included are:\n\nZork I\nZork II\nZork III\nBeyond Zork\nZork Zero\nEnchanter\nSorcerer\nSpellbreaker\nDeadline\nThe Witness\nSuspect\nThe Lurking Horror\nBallyhoo\nInfidel\nMoonmist\nStarcross\nSuspended\nPlanetfall\nStationfall\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nThe package contains all the instructions (bound in one volume) and maps for each game as well as all the InvisiClues, printed normally instead of using \"invisible\" ink. The package also features a launch menu which lets the user select which one of the 20 games they wish to play.\n\nAn additional bonus was the updated version of Hitchhiker's Guide. The game was repackaged using a later version of the Z-machine than the original, and now featured a built-in hint system.\n\nSome significant omissions from the package were the \"feelies\" for which Infocom had become known.
